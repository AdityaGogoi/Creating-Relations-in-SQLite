# Creating-Relations-in-SQLite
Normalize data using relations in SQLite

In the 'Data Preperation for SQLite' project, I learnt how to clean and prepare the original CSV dataset on Academy Award nominations and export the data into a SQLite database as a single, denormalized table. In this project, I will normalize our single table into multiple tables and to create relations between them.
